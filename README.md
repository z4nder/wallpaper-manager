## Auto-start on Login

Add to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```ini
exec-once = swww-daemon
exec-once = wallpaper-manager apply
```

> This ensures the `swww` daemon starts and the wallpaper is restored on login.

---

## File Organization

By default, the program looks for images in:

```
~/.config/backgrounds
```

Place your wallpapers in this folder. For example:

- `~/.config/backgrounds/meadow.jpg`
- `~/.config/backgrounds/dark-moon.png`
